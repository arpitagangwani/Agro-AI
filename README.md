# 🌾 Agro AI – Intelligent Crop Recommendation & Revenue Analysis System

**Agro AI** is a modern agriculture decision-support system that leverages machine learning and data analytics to recommend the most suitable crops based on soil and weather parameters. It also includes a profit/loss calculator to help farmers estimate financial outcomes based on cultivation costs and expected yield.

This system is developed using **React.js** for the frontend, **Flask (Python)** for the backend, and a trained **ML model** using Scikit-learn for crop prediction.
